===============
Getting Started
===============

Plug the VESC board
-------------------

To plug in the VESC board, you need an actuator with a carrier board.

===============
Upload Firmware
===============

Take your actuator with the VESC board, connect the power supply, and link it to a computer using a USB cable.

Open VESC tool and connect to your actuator (see: :ref:`usb-connect`).

In the left menu, go to Firmware, Then select the ``Custom File`` tab. 

.. |ico1| image:: Images/Open_file_icon.png

On the first row, click on ``Choose file...`` |ico1|, select the file ``src/vesc_bldc/build/a50s_v23c_8s/a50s_v23c_8s.hex``.

.. |ico2| image:: Images/Upload_icon.png

At the bottom of the tab, click on ``Update firmaware on the connected VESC`` |ico2|, a window will appear, click on ``Yes``.

.. image:: Images/Update_firmware.png

Wait for the Firmware to upload.

.. warning:: 

    Do not unplug the actuator while uploading the firmware!

When the upload is done, a window will appear, click on ``OK``

.. image:: Images/Reconnection.png

Wait a moment before reconnecting to the actuator. You are done!

===============================
Load a base motor configuration
===============================

.. |ico3| image:: Images/Write_m_conf_icon.png

Click on ``File`` in the top-left corner of the window, select ``Load motor configuration XML``. Choose the appropriate file, ``OR17S_BASE_120.xml`` or ``OR17S_BASE_80.xml``, based on your actuator's reduction.

Once the file is loaded, click on ``Write motor configuration`` |ico3| on the right side of the window. A pop-up will appear, click on ``OK``

======================
Sin Cos calibration
======================

In the left menu, go to ``LispBM Scripting``. Then click on ``Open file...`` |ico2| at the bottom of the ``main`` tab. Open ``src/VESC_scripts_config/scripts/SINCOS_Calib/00-Full identification.lisp`` and click on ``Stream`` at the top of the window.
 
.. warning:: 

    The actuator will move during calibration, so ensure it is safe to proceed.

When the calibration is complete the actuator will make a sound. In the ``Console/REPL`` tab, verify that you see the message ``Module mean check ok, settings values``.

.. |ico4| image:: Images/Read_m_conf_icon.png

Once calibration is done, click on ``Read motor configuration`` |ico4| on the right side of the window to update the values.

==================
Encoder detection
==================

In the ``Motor Settings`` menu on the left, click on ``General``. In the ``General`` tab, ensure that the ``Motor Type`` is set to ``FOC``.

.. image:: Images/Check_foc.png

Next, go to the ``FOC`` menu on the left and click on the ``Encoder`` tab. At the bottom of the screen under ``Detect Encoder``, change ``I`` from 10.00A to 3.00A.

.. |ico5| image:: Images/Play_icon.png

Click on the play button |ico5| to start the detection. 

.. warning:: 

    The actuator will move during calibration, so ensure it is safe to proceed.

.. |ico6| image:: Images/Apply_icon.png

Wait for the ``Offset`` and ``Ratio`` values to update, this indicate that the detection is complete. Once finished, click on the ``Apply`` button |ico6|, then on ``Write motor configuration`` |ico3| on the right side of the window to save the change.
